# AutoPySpammer
A Python program that spams someone's email inbox with a LOT of random generated messages.


## How to use

1. Activate 2FA (Authentication Ã  2 facteurs or A2F) on your gmail Account.
2. Go to "App password" (you can search it in the top research bar).
3. Name the app Python or something recognisable.
4. Copy the given key.
5. Open the program.
6. Fill in your target's email.
7. Fill in the email your activated 2FA/created an "App Password".
8. Fill in the "App Password" with the password you just generated. (You must remove the empty spaces for it to work).
9. Select how many emails you wanna send.
10. Press send.
11. And now wait ! Your target's inbox is getting filled with various random and benign mails that won't get you into trouble.  
The send button should unpress himself when the mails are finished sending. If at any point, the app seems to crash, IT IS NOT. Let it run even if it says it stopped working or is not answering. It takes a lot of time to send emails, roughly one every 10 seconds.
